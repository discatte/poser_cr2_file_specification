I'm going to run down the CR2 format in the way you would expect to see it
within a text editor.  The first section is the Geometry.
</P>
<P>
The Geometry is actually the second section in the CR2 format.  The first is
actually the version info and really shouldn't be removed or changed.  This
leaves the geometry section as the first section you can play with.
</P>
<P>
There are two different formats for this section.  The first format we will
deal with is custom geometry.  In custom geometry each and every body part
should be defined, this includes the BODY that you will find in the poser
menues.  The BODY usually has no geometry of it's own as it is the top level
piece that contains all other parts.  Following the BODY entry will be
entries for each body part (in OBJ syntax this is a group).  The body part
syntax will be like this:
</P>
<P>
actor Partname:1 (the number is the character number and should be the same
in all parts)
<BR>
    {
<BR>
<blockquote>
    geomCustom
<BR>
        {
<BR>
<blockquote>
        (here will be a listing of all vertices, faces, and even texture
groups for each part in OBJ format)
<BR>
</blockquote>
        }
<BR>
</blockquote>
    }
</P>
<P>
Each and every body part will be listed.  If you have custom geometry in
your file, it is probably responsible for about 90% of it's size.
</P>
<P>
The second option is to have a geometry reference file (OBJ file) that
contains the geometry.  This option has a lot of advantages over custom
geometry.  The first of which is if you need to make any changes to the mesh
all you would have to do is change the geometry file itself and all your
joints remain in thier original settings.  The one thing to remember when
modifying and OBJ geometry is that all body part names need to remain the
same.  If you are adding a new part name then you will need a new CR2 file
to go with it.  The format for this option is simple and I will list it
here:
</P>
<P>
figureResFile :Path:Filename.OBJ
<BR>
Actor Body:1
<BR>
    {
<BR>
    }
<BR>
actor Partname:1
<BR>
    {
<BR>
<blockquote>
    storageOffset 0 0 0
<BR>
    geomHandlerGeom 13 groupname
<BR>
</blockquote>
    }
<BR>
figureResFile :Path:Filename.OBJ
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The reference option opens and closes with a pointer to the actual OBJ file.
The syntax for the path will usually start with :Runtime and list the full
path to the file from there.  This needs to follow the Mac format for paths
which state that subfolders are separated by a colon (:) and all
capitalization matters (ape is not equal to Ape).  The body definition is
the same as with custom geometry.
</P>
<P>
When we get to the different body parts, we now no longer have the geometry
listed, but we still need to link the group names in the OBJ file to the
body part names in Poser.  The Partname listing shows the name of the body
part as displayed by poser*.  The geomHandlerGeom 13 groupname should
exactly match the group name within the OBJ file.  This tells Poser which
group to use for the defined body part.  The storage offset is the units in
cartesian coordinates (that's the 3 dimensional measuring system XYZ) that
the geometry should be moved from it's default location in the OBJ file.
The storage offset for most models is always 0 0 0, this keeps the groups in
the same relative location as when they were modelled.
</P>
<P>
If you want the extended capabilities that having an OBJ reference gives you
but your CR2 file has the geometry listed in its custom geometry format what
do you do?  Actually this has an easy. if tedious, solution, and I will
explain it without use of other tools.
</P>
<P>
First thing to do is back up the files then load the figure into poser and
then go to the menu and restore the figure.  What this will do is take away
any modifications the CR2 file put into place**.  Then export this figure as
an object file.  During export, select every option with the exception of
"As Morph Target" and give it a unique name.  Go ahead and exit out of poser
because poser will maintain a lock on the CR2 file and you won't be able to
edit it.  Once out, open the CR2 file in any text editor that can handle
large files.  I tend to use Wordpad.  Look for the first Partname and select
all partname info in the geometry area and delete it, be sure to make note
of the different partnames though.  Next add the reference to the OBJ file
and the partname/OBJ cross reference following the syntax listed above.  You
may need to take a peek into the OBJ file to see the group names as saved in
poser.  Once all names are matched up, save the CR2 file, go back to poser
and load the figure and test it out.

Footnotes:
</P>
<P>
*This is not entirely true as the partnames can be changed in a later
section
</P>
<P>
**This also is not true as there can be a defualt starting modification that
is saved when you restore the figure.  If you want to export a figure with
some of these, you need to make a backup of the CR2 and set all those
starting values to 0 before loading it back into poser and exporting.  These
cases will be explained within thier sections.
