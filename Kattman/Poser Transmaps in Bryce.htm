    This image shows how great it looks inside poser itself, <br>
    yet when you load it into Bryce, it can look really bad.&nbsp; <br>
    This tutorial will show you how to get this same look in Bryce.</td>

    mesh to OBJ format.&nbsp; These are the settings I use for all my exports to Bryce.&nbsp; <br>
    It gives me a ton of grouped objects to play with <br>
    so I tend to export each character separately.</td>

    <td width="573">On first importing to Bryce I created a render.&nbsp; <br>
    Bryce of course asked me for the location of the texture map but ignored the
    transmap.&nbsp;<br>
    As you can see, it is textured nicely but the edges are real hard, <br>
    not quite good enough for hair. </td>

    <td width="573">Select your object and go into the material editor.&nbsp; <br>
    Once there, look at the transparency slider, notice the dot.&nbsp; <br>
    Place that dot in an empty channel.&nbsp; That channel will load a default texture.&nbsp; <br>
    Change it to a picture texture then go into the deep texture editor for that
    channel.&nbsp; <br>
    What you will see are three large boxes near the top and <br>
    a bunch of little boxes at the bottom.&nbsp; Select an empty box and load the transmap
    there.</td>

    <td width="573">Once the transmap is loaded you will see it fill the top boxes with the
    selection.&nbsp; <br>
    Keep in mind that the Bryce editor will show a <br>
    checkerboard pattern for all transparent areas.&nbsp; <br>
    Looking at the image to the right, you can see that in the third box <br>
    there is no transparent areas.&nbsp; The third box is the final map used.&nbsp; <br>
    The first box is basically a starting point, the second is a modifier.&nbsp; <br>
    We need to use both of these to create the transparency. </td>

  <tr>
    <td width="573">Bryce tends to read transmaps backwards so we have to flip the values
    around here.&nbsp; <br>
    The method of doing so is fairly easy.&nbsp; <br>
    In the first box select copy, then paste into the second box.&nbsp; <br>
    Bryce will ask if you want to delete, go ahead and do so.&nbsp; <br>
    Next push that little black and white split button to reverse the colors.&nbsp; <br>
    Copy the second box back to the first, once again deleting when it asks.&nbsp; <br>
    Next, push that black and white button again to reverse the second box one more
    time.&nbsp; You should end up with something like the photo.&nbsp; <br>
    Notice now how the third box shows the transparent area in checkerboard <br>
    and the rest as solid black.&nbsp; <br>
    This is what we need so hit the check mark at the bottom of the editor to save it.</td>

    <td width="573">Upon returning to the material editor, these are the setting we should
    usually see.&nbsp; <br>
    Notice the Surface diffusion is set to the first texture channel.&nbsp; <br>
    That channel holds the texture map.&nbsp; <br>
    The transparency slider is in the second channel.&nbsp; <br>
    That channel holds the transparency map we just modified.&nbsp;<br>
    It all looks good here so let's go render. </td>

    <td width="573">Well, the transparency went in, sorta.&nbsp; <br>
    We can see the different strands of hair now, but if you look closely <br>
    you will see the transparent areas are ghosted.&nbsp; <br>
    They have a white glow to them.&nbsp; <br>
    This is caused by the diffusion on the texture map.&nbsp; <br>
    Those parts of the texture map are white so it shows up here as a glow.&nbsp; <br>
    We need to get rid of that, but how.</td>

  <tr>
    <td width="573">I had tried tweaking the diffusion slider changing channels <br>
    and all kinds of things to get rid of that ghosting effect.&nbsp; <br>
    The solution became real simple once I found it.&nbsp; <br>
    Notice the Diffusion slider, you will be tempted to set that to <br>
    the same channel as the surface diffusion hut don't.&nbsp; <br>
    Leave the slider at 100 and set the dot to your transparency channel.&nbsp; <br>
    What this basically does is tell it to diffuse only those areas <br>
    not marked as transparent, essentially making all transparent areas truly transparent.</td>

    <td width="573"><img border="0" src="tut9.jpg" WIDTH="283" HEIGHT="355"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="573">Go back out and render.&nbsp; <br>
    You will see the fine hair as Koz wanted it to be seen.&nbsp; <br>
    The ghosting is gone and the fringe looks good.&nbsp; <br>
    The edges are nice and soft like hair should look.&nbsp; <br>
    This same technique can be applied to bump maps but <br>
    you won't need to worry about the ghosting effect there <br>
    so setting the diffusion to the transparency channel isn't required.&nbsp; <br>
    Unless of course you have a transmap applied also.</td>
