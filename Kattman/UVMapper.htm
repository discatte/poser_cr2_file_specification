     .

<XMP>UVMapper is one of those applications that has become a necessity in
my battery of tools.  Without that little utility, there is no way I could
put out the models I do.  Only one problem with UVMapper, the documentation.
Let's see if I can clear thing up a little.

When importing a new OBJ file that has no UVMapping at all, you will receive
a screen full of randomly placed vertex lines.  To get a feel for the views
as related to poser do these things:

Go to Edit-New UV Map-Planer.  Select no gaps, don't split, scale result and
use the Z-axis for the view.  After saying OK you will see a somewhat decent
representation of the object.  Now the question will be, "What direction are
we looking at this from?"  The z-axis relates to the front as viewed from
Poser.  The axis views are as follows:

z-axis = Poser front
y-axis = Poser Bottom
x-axis =  Poser

Left So how do you get a top or right hand  view? This requires a
little  thinking. Go back to the menu and select  Edit-Rotate. You will see a
small dialog box with three areas to put in the degree of  rotation. You can
only enter integers and either positive or  negative. When rotating an OBJ,
the rotation always happens from the default 0, not from it's current
rotation. For example, if you rotate something 10 degrees then go back and rotate
it with a value of 5 degrees in the same axis, the total rotation will be 5
not

15. Now how do you know what direction to  rotate? Look back at the
viewing  direction. If you rotate on the Y axis, the rotation will go in a
clockwise direction as seen from the  bottom. Following this the z-axis will
rotate from the front in a clockwise direction

also. When combining rotations on two axis, you may receive unexpected
results. This is due to the fact that rotations will always happen at one  time.
When rotating along three axis at once sometimes there is no way to know
where the object will end  up. My recommendation is to use as few rotations
as possible to achieve the results you

want. Just a few other quick items for this short tutorial/explanation  thing.
Go back to the menu and select  Edit-Select. You will see a few items on
this  list. The one I have found more helpful is the select by  group. This
will allow you to grab just a piece of the model as defined by the current
groups in the OBJ  file. Once you have it selected, you can use the rotate and
New UV Map menus on just the selected

piece. Remember back at the beginning of this I mentioned using the Scale
Result  option. I find this extremely important to prevent stretching of a
texture  map. This option will size the selection with the same relative
dimensions as the OBJ  file. Keep in mind, I also said use No  Gaps. This will keep
the selection tight against the geometry of the

object. Now usually, the resulting mapping will be fairly  small. If  you attempt
to resize the selection using the mouse you will once again see stretching
of the texture map as you won't be keeping with the relative dimensions of
the  model. To prevent this always resize using the + and - keys on the
keypad. The number keys will move a model around and real fine increments
for precision in placing the UVs where you want

them. In preparation for final poser mapping, you will want to define the
textures and  groups. Go back to the menu and select  Edit-Assign. This will show
you a couple fo different  options. The only ones relative to poser are
Group and  Texture. As a rule I always split my textures  first. If your model
is made with all the different texture and group pieces as separate groups
this becomes an easy but tedious  task. Just select a group and assign it
a texture  first. Once all your textures are assigned then go back and
select the proper groups and re-group them in their proper

groups. For example, I have an box like object I want to be a  TV. I model it
so that the control panel, screen and body are three separate  pieces. I UV
map them the way I want and now need to get the proper textures and groups
set. I will select the screen object and set the texture group to  screen. I
do the same for the control panel and  body. After setting the textures I
then go back and select all the objects and set then to the group  "TV". If I
had set the group first, I would not have been able to go back and select
the different parts and set their texture

easily. After all of this, you will need to save the new model and texture
template. Save the model  first. Go to File-Save  model. The options I always use
are Export normals, Export UV Coordinates, Export Materials and Export
UVMapper  Regions. Easy enough, and you can guess why yourself by this

point. To save the texture map go to File-Save Texture  Map. This will give you
a dialog box asking for size and a few  parameters. The only parameter I
use is Exclude Hidden  Facets. This allows me to have the map look as
it currently does on screen if I had to hide faces I didn't want to have
show  up. The size of the map is kind of

funny. After all this work to get things to look right and using the Scale
Result when creating the template, UVMapper does nothing for you in determining
the final dimensions of the  image. Chances are, if you save with the
default size, the texture map will once again get  stretched. My trick here is
in knowing the relative dimensions of UVMappers workspace on my screen.
Running at 1024x756, the workspace is 1029x709.  This is my starting point
for the save size.  If I want a real high-resolution map I will multiply both
dimensions by either 2, 3 or 4. I

hope this gets you started.  Play around with some of the other mapping
options besides planer and you will be able to create a template for
anything you want.</XMP>
